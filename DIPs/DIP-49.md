## Summary of Proposal
ETH SEA communities uniting and showcasing various cultures during Devcon7. The hub creates a natural and progressive environment to connect with builders, supporters and 
newcomers to learn more about why SEA stands to be a competitive player for the Ethereum ecosystem. We meet, build, and grow together

## Abstract
With Devcon coming to Southeast Asia we are introducing a SEA community hub to showcase culture, builder highlights and community collaboration across the existing
Ethereum communities within the region. This will also be a station presenting visitors what SEA has achieved on building in Ethereum, 
Identifying opportunities for cross collaboration globally

## Offering
We will offer a blend of culture and tech presenting what ETH SEA has achieved, what is currently pursuing and what to look forward to. 
We plan to do an interactive map of SEA as well to display various builders and projects that were founded in SEA as well as various community meet-ups, hackathons, events, etc. 
Merch and goodies will also be available with the support from Ethereum SEA communities

## Implementation
- Entering the SEA community hub is an interactive map showcasing various SEA grown projects, builders, events, and communities.
- A desk will also be prepared to position goodies/giveaways from various countries such as keychains, artifacts and travel cards with a QR code.
The QR directs you to the website of the ETH community specific to that travel card region.
- Vertical walls will be in place to pin up pamphlets and brochures from SEA projects to give awareness.
- Another wall will be in place to showcase culture, go-to locations, and festivities about SEA countries
